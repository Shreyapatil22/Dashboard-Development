##The development of the interactive sales dashboard began with data collection and preprocessing, where sales data from a CSV file was loaded and cleaned using Pandas to handle missing values and ensure consistency. The Dash framework was then set up, with a structured layout using HTML components and a dropdown menu (dcc.Dropdown()) for selecting sales regions.
For visualization, Plotly Express was used to create a Sales Trend Line Chart (px.line()) and a Sales Distribution Histogram (px.histogram()), with customized colors for better readability. To enable real-time updates, a callback function (@app.callback) linked the dropdown menu with the graphs, dynamically filtering and updating the data based on user selection. Finally, the dashboard was embedded into Jupyter Notebook, making it a user-friendly and efficient analytics tool.
